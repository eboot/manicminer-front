ManicMiner Pool Front
=====================

ManicMiner project's front app.
A web application written in padrino.

This app was the front of the ManicMiner Multicoin Mining Pool. Is here for historical reasons and maybe for educational
purposes too.

The code doesn't pretend to be an example to anybody, and we think it isn't really usable as is because it is tightly
integrated with the underlying system, not present here.
